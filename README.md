# Github-Finder
A small application to find Users and their repositories, using Github API.
Uses, Async and Await.
Please note that the Github API only allows 100 requests, therefore one must register an oauth in Github.
Since this is purely a testing application, the client key and client secret is hard-coded. Please do not practice this in development.
